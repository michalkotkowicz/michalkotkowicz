#### About Me

Hey there! My name is Michael. I am a guy from Poland trying to make a living in Germany. 
After some time working in logistics, I decided to change my life in this country, and made a training to become a Web Developer.
After successfully finishing my training, I am currently on a search of an internship or a work as Junior Web Developer.
